## Summary

That's it for this lab. Now you know that all the objects in OpenShift can be labeled.  This is important because those labels can be used as part of your CI/CD process.  An upcoming lab will cover using labels for Blue/Green deployments. Labels can also be used for running your apps on specific nodes (e.g. just on SSD nodes or just on east coast nodes).
