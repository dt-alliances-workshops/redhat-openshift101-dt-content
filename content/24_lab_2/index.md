## Lab 2  Deploying Dynatrace OpenShift Observability

One key Dynatrace advantage is ease of activation. OneAgent technology simplifies deployment across large enterprises and relieves engineers of the burden of instrumenting their applications by hand. As OpenShift adoption continues to grow it becomes more important than ever to simplify the activation of observability across workloads without sacrificing the deployment automation that OpenShift provides. Observability should be as cloud-native as OpenShift itself.

In our workshop, we will install the Dynatrace Operator that streamlines lifecycle management.  You can read more about it here in this [Dynatrace blog](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/new-dynatrace-operator-elevates-cloud-native-observability-for-kubernetes/). Additionally we will configure ingestion of Kubernetes events and view this information in the Dynatrace UI.
