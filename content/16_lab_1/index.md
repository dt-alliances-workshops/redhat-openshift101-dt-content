## Lab 1 BYO Container Overview

# Bring your own docker
It's easy to get started with OpenShift whether you're using our app templates or bringing your existing assets.  In this quick lab we will deploy an application using an exisiting container image.  OpenShift will create an image stream for the image as well as deploy and manage containers based on that image.  And we will dig into the details to show how all that works.

In this and other labs you'll have the option of choosing to use the CLI or the Web Console. Please choose one, but not both as the steps are repeated.

# Summary
In this lab you've deployed an example container image, pulled from Quay.io, into a pod running in OpenShift.  You exposed a route for clients to access that service via thier web browsers.  And you learned how to get and describe resources using the command line and the web console.  Hopefully, this basic lab also helped to get you familiar with using the CLI and navigating within the web console.
