## Summary

In this lab we saw how you can configure a source code repository to trigger builds with webhooks.  This webhook could come from Github, Jenkins, Travis-CI, or any tool capable of sending a URL POST.  Keep in mind that there are other types of build triggers you can setup.  For example: if a new version of the upstream RHEL image changes.  We also inspected our deployment history and did a rollback of our running deployment to one based on an older image with the click of a button.
