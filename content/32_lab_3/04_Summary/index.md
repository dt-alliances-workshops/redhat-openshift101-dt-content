## Summary
In this lab we deployed a sample application using source to image.  This process built our code and wrapped that in a docker image.  It then deployed the image into our OpenShift platform in a pod and exposed a route to allow outside web traffic to access our application.  We then examined the discovered architecture of the application in Dynatrace.  In the next lab we will deploy a multi-tier that includes a frontend, backend, and database tier.
